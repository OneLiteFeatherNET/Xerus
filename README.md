## Features

The Xerus library is designed specifically for creating games within a Minecraft environment. It offers a range of
features that simplify game development, including:

- **Kits**: Easily create and manage player kits, which can include items, abilities, and other attributes.
- **Teams**: Organize players into teams, enabling team-based gameplay and interactions.
- **Phase System**: Implement a flexible game state system that supports various gameplay phases, such as preparation,
  active play, and endgame.

## Internationalization (i18n) Support

Certain parts of the library support internationalization (i18n), allowing you to develop games playable in multiple
languages. This feature is crucial for reaching a global audience and improving the player experience.

If your project uses internationalization, itâ€™s important to ensure that any checks in your code consider the language
context. Failing to do so may result in unexpected behavior or unintended side effects.

## Getting Started

The usage of Xerus requires the Minestom / Microtus dependencies are included in your project.
If that is the case, you can add the Xerus library to your project using the following dependency:
`net.theevilreaper.xerus:xerus:<version>`.
Replace `<version>` with the desired version of the library.
