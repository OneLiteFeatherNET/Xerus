## Features

The Xerus library is designed specifically for creating games within a Minecraft environment. It offers a range of
features that simplify game development, including:

- **Kits**: Easily create and manage player kits, which can include items, abilities, and other attributes.
- **Teams**: Organize players into teams, enabling team-based gameplay and interactions.
- **Phase System**: Implement a flexible game state system that supports various gameplay phases, such as preparation,
  active play, and endgame.

## Internationalization (i18n) Support

Certain parts of the library support internationalization (i18n), allowing you to develop games playable in multiple
languages. This feature is crucial for reaching a global audience and improving the player experience.

If your project uses internationalization, itâ€™s important to ensure that any checks in your code consider the language
context. Failing to do so may result in unexpected behavior or unintended side effects.

## Getting Started

To use **Xerus**, you must first have [**Minestom**](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) set up in your project.  
Once that's done, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("net.theevilreaper:xerus:1.0.0")
}
```
